"""The ``pyx`` console script: hand over to the native binary.

Wheels built by the release workflow carry ``pyxray/bin/pyx`` (or ``pyx.exe``)
for their platform, so ``pip install pyxray`` gives you the CLI as well as
the package. A wheel built locally with ``maturin develop`` has no binary in
it; this then looks for one on ``PATH`` or in a checkout, and says how to
get one if there is none.
